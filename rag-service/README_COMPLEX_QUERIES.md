# How CatalystAI Handles Complex Product Requirements

## üéØ **The Challenge: Complex, Multi-Faceted Queries**

Product teams often come with complex requirements that span multiple domains:

> *"I am building a new feature from UI where I have vendorId and I need generate forecasting in supply chain, which APIs I need to consume and any onboarding required, Do Our app need to follow any recommendations and practices when integrating we are expecting a TPS of 2500 will the appropriate downstream support this and any changes they need to do to support this additional traffic"*

## üß† **CatalystAI's Intelligent Response Process**

### **1. Query Analysis & Intent Detection**

Our system automatically decomposes complex queries into multiple dimensions:

- **Primary Intent**: Supply Chain Forecasting API Discovery
- **Key Entities**: vendorId, supply chain forecasting, 2500 TPS
- **Search Dimensions**: 
  - API Discovery
  - Performance Requirements
  - Integration Guidance
  - Infrastructure Impact

### **2. Multi-Layer Search Strategy**

Instead of a single search, CatalystAI performs targeted searches for each intent:

```python
# API Discovery Search
api_results = await search_service.hybrid_search(
    query="supply chain forecasting APIs",
    filters=SearchFilter(api_styles=["REST", "GraphQL"], tags=["supply-chain"])
)

# Onboarding Requirements Search
onboarding_results = await search_service.hybrid_search(
    query="onboarding access requirements supply chain API",
    filters=SearchFilter(tags=["onboarding", "access", "permissions"])
)

# Integration Guidance Search
integration_results = await search_service.hybrid_search(
    query="integration best practices patterns supply chain API",
    filters=SearchFilter(tags=["integration", "best-practices"])
)
```

### **3. Intelligent Result Synthesis**

The system combines search results with business logic to provide comprehensive answers:

#### **API Discovery Results**
- **Supply Chain Forecasting API**: 95% relevance, supports vendorId
- **Vendor Management API**: 89% relevance, high performance
- **Supply Chain Analytics API**: 87% relevance, insights generation

#### **Onboarding Requirements**
- Required scopes and permissions
- Authentication methods
- Rate limiting information
- Approval timelines and dependencies

#### **Integration Recommendations**
- Architecture patterns (Circuit Breaker, Async/Await)
- Performance optimizations (batching, caching)
- Security best practices
- Monitoring and observability

### **4. Performance & Infrastructure Analysis**

For the 2500 TPS requirement, CatalystAI automatically:

- **Analyzes Current Capacity**: Identifies APIs needing scaling
- **Calculates Scaling Requirements**: 2.5x - 5x capacity increases
- **Estimates Infrastructure Costs**: $3,700-9,500/month additional
- **Assesses Downstream Impact**: Team responsibilities and timelines

### **5. Actionable Next Steps**

The system generates prioritized action items:

```
High Priority:
‚Ä¢ Submit API access requests for all three services
‚Ä¢ Engage Infrastructure team for capacity planning

Medium Priority:
‚Ä¢ Design integration architecture with Engineering team
‚Ä¢ Create performance test plan for 2500 TPS

Timeline: 4-6 weeks total implementation
```

## üîç **Technical Implementation**

### **Query Processing Pipeline**

```python
class ComplexQueryProcessor:
    async def process_complex_query(self, query: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        # 1. Intent Analysis
        query_analysis = self._analyze_query_intent(query)
        
        # 2. Targeted Searches
        search_results = await self._perform_targeted_searches(
            query, query_analysis
        )
        
        # 3. Response Generation
        comprehensive_response = self._generate_comprehensive_response(
            query_analysis, search_results
        )
        
        # 4. Performance Analysis
        performance_analysis = self._analyze_performance_requirements(
            query_analysis
        )
        
        # 5. Impact Assessment
        downstream_impact = self._assess_downstream_impact(
            query_analysis, performance_analysis
        )
        
        return {
            "query_analysis": query_analysis,
            "api_discovery": search_results["api_discovery"],
            "onboarding_requirements": search_results["onboarding"],
            "integration_recommendations": search_results["integration"],
            "performance_analysis": performance_analysis,
            "downstream_impact": downstream_impact,
            "next_steps": self._generate_next_steps(...)
        }
```

### **Intent Detection Patterns**

```python
intent_patterns = {
    "api_discovery": [
        r"which APIs?",
        r"APIs I need",
        r"consume.*API"
    ],
    "onboarding": [
        r"onboarding.*required",
        r"access.*needed",
        r"permission.*required"
    ],
    "integration_guidance": [
        r"recommendations",
        r"best practices",
        r"patterns"
    ],
    "performance_requirements": [
        r"TPS",
        r"throughput",
        r"capacity"
    ]
}
```

### **Business Domain Recognition**

```python
domain_patterns = {
    "supply_chain": [
        r"supply chain",
        r"forecasting",
        r"inventory"
    ],
    "vendor_management": [
        r"vendor",
        r"supplier",
        r"vendorId"
    ]
}
```
